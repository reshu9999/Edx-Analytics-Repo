You can access information about what individual learners are doing in your
course, and how frequently: from the edX Insights menu select **Learners**. A
report of the key activity metrics for all enrolled learners appears, including
problems tried and videos played. You can then review a chart of individual
learner activity over time by selecting a learner by username.
